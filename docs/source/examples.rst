Getting Started Guide
=====================

The RTI Connext DDS Getting Started Guide examples can be found 
`in this repository <https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-getting-started>`_.

Clone the repository. In ``2_hello_world/python`` (and ``3_streaming_data/python``, 
and so on), a **readme** includes instructions for how to go through the example.

For a full walk-through, see the 
`Getting Started Guide for Modern C++ <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.1/doc/manuals/connext_dds/getting_started/index.html>`_.
The Python example is a translation
of the Modern C++ version, so the Modern C++ Getting Started Guide is a great resource.

Python Examples
===============

More Python examples can be found in the 
`connextdds-py repository <https://github.com/rticommunity/connextdds-py/tree/master/examples>`_.
