Getting Started Guide
=====================

The RTI Getting Started Guide can be found 
`in this repository <https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-getting-started>`_.
It is recommended that you clone the repository.
After cloning, you should enter the folder 1_hello_world/python and 
there will be a readme. The readme will include instructions for 
how to go through the example.
For a full walk through, you can go
`to this page <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.1/doc/manuals/connext_dds/getting_started/index.html>`_.
This is the Getting Started Guide for Modern C++. The Python Guide is a translation
of the Modern C++ version so the Modern C++ Getting Started Guide is a great resource.

Python Examples
===============

Some Python Examples can be found in the connextdds-py repository 
`here <https://github.com/rticommunity/connextdds-py/tree/master/examples>`_.
